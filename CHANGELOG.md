# 0.0.2

* [NEW] `lint`, `changelog`, `githubComment`, `packageVersion` and `stdout` actions.
* [DEV] Basic architecture, allowing to add actions independently

# 0.0.1

* [NEW] A library, kept as small as possible. It allows to check stuff that usually can be seen in CI logs and add a comment with some checks to Pull Request. In the end it I hope it will be as functional as codecov, but free.
